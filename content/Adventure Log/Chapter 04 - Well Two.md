> [!danger] Chupacabra
> [[Yuki]] runs to the fore, gets crit-dropped by chupacabra
> [[Rowena]] [[Tukai]] [[Horra]] try to flank it, [[Yuki]] crawls away and goes invisible

**kick in the door** into the next room

> [!danger] Skeletons
> a dozen skeletons from great hall converge on the doorway, held by [[Rowena]] and [[Tukai]]
> [[Urist]] gets sniped right away
> [[Rowena]] holds the line and tanks tens of skeleton attacks, but inevitably nabs a few punches
> [[Tukai]] desperately tries to find a bludgeoning weapon he can use effectively
> skeletons amass and fuse into a Skeleton Giant, that approaches and drops [[Rowena]] and Horra
> [[Yuki]] narrowly downs the lumbering bone mass with Telekinetic Projectiles

one hour of recovering from the near-TPK
into the room, find a key, open locked door to narrow and long corridor ahead

> [!danger] Minotaur
> [[Tukai]] opens with sending Horra to charge crit the Minoraur and also critting him himself
> on death's door, the Minotaur responds by crit-oneshotting [[Horra]]
> [[Yuki]] finishes him off with Magic Missile

### Session 14 / 2022-09-04

party passes into Bramble corridor
[[Rowena]] goes first and is separated by dark root wall from rest of party
they mash her on the wall trying to pull her through

> [!question] arcane sigils: "How many dryads are imprisoned on the roof?" 
> the answer was 14 from 14.3

> [!danger] 5 Dryads and Giant Tree
> a big fat zone of Entangle
> the tree's roots sprawled across the room, they savage the party every round
> inching closer to the TPK
> [[Urist]] buys a few seconds with lvl 1 Heal through Wajabat, end result is the same
> > ashes, ashes, we all fall down

> [!example] Vision: θολες φιγουρες
> `1st figure`
> He 's gone. What are we gonna do now?
> `2nd figure`
> Over a hundred years, it all was for nothing.
> `Chandor`
> I knew him less than all of you. And for all the things that have been said about him, the truth is that he did not understand many things, but he understood that sometimes sacrafices are nessesary. He acted accordingly.
> `4th figure`
> *( looks at Chandor )*
> I trusted him with my life, as did you, but he was easily manipulated
> *( looks angrily at the 5th figure).*
> `5th figure (clearly elven)`
> No one can deny that he achieved the unachievable and he was able to do that only by aiming for the unimaginable. You all can hate me as much as you want, but the truth is that he knew the risks, he did what he believed was right, and as much as you want to blame me for this conclusion, deep down you all know it was his choice. He might be gone but the cause isn't. His name still has power and we have every right to use it. After all we are...
> `Chandor`
> *( furious )*
> Stop talking. No one has the right to abuse his name and by no means keep pursuing this pointless cause. His addiction to prevent one imaginary threat was his undoing. When we had the chance we all followed him instead of stopping him, but you pushed him further. The rest is history. We should celebrate his life instead of fixating on his death.

σηκωνομαστε εμβρονητοι κατω απο καμενο δεντρο
ακολουθουμε μακρυ διαδρομο πισω στην εισοδο
ο [[Al]] εχει συνθλιβει απο την παγιδα, το χερι του πολτος
τον σηκωνει [[Rowena]] με κριτ αθλετιξ σε φορειο απο πηγαδι
συντομη διαμαχη με [[Tukai]] για το αν πρεπει να τον καψουμε ή να τον θαψουμε
εν τελει τον θαβουμε και βαζουμε ενα μικρο cairn απο πανω, last rites, πισω στη λασπη
κλεινουμε το πηγαδι με το ritual που βρηκαμε στις σημειωσεις του [[Al]]
> crit-nailed the incantation! enunciation classes at the academy actually proved useful

> [!check] λεβελ ωπ
> mouuunt up: to Melinor!
