international peacekeeping organisation
regulating humanoid-dragon relations since the 20th century
- most states and dragons abide by the pact, but not all
- have penned a bunch of legistature to determine the land distribution

## Pact Keepers
task force built to make sure the Pact is upheld in the regions it encompasses
led by 6 Listeners and 12 Enforcers

## Wyrmsfall
descendant faction of the dragon hunter association that scared the dragons into backing off
they hold a stake in the organisation mostly so the dragons won't try to pull off any funny business
